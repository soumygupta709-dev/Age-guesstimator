# Age-guesstimator

This repository contains a simple age estimation project that predicts a person's approximate age from an input image.  
The project is designed to be minimal, modular, and easy to extend.

##  Project Overview

The system takes an image as input, preprocesses it, and estimates the age using a trained model.  
Current implementation includes placeholder logic that can be replaced with a real deep learning model.

##  Project Structure

- `app.py` – Runs the application and handles user input
- `model.py` – Loads the model and performs age prediction
- `utils.py` – Image loading and preprocessing utilities
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
